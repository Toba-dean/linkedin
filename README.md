![LinkedIn Clone](https://i.ibb.co/D5vF36x/linkedIn.png)

## 📣 Summary
This application is built on the original linkedIn app, it is built with the Next Js frame work and uses tailwind Css for styling. It uses other frameworks like framer motion for animation, recoil for state management. It is a full stack application that uses the mongo DB for database storage.

It does not implement all the functionalities of the real linkedIn application, but it works fine and it is a beautiful clone which is also responsive.
